  description: "Hello! I'm Caleb Newton, a follower of Jesus and USC freshman studying Computer Science + Applied Mathematics. I'm passionate about building AI systems that serve people, grounded in my Christian faith and commitment to human-centered technology. Currently diving deep into the technical foundations of machine learning: PyTorch, transformers, computer vision, and ranking systems. My technical journey spans deep learning workflows, neural architectures like ViT and EfficientNet, and production ML tools including Docker, evaluation harnesses, and model deployment. Outside of code, I'm into vinyl records, board games, hiking, baseball, and making learning joyful. My goal: become a Machine Learning or Data Engineer who builds technology that genuinely helps people flourish.",
